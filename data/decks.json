For example, instead of asking {@i Why am I always sad?} try {@i How do I bring more joy to my life?}",

In this {@i Heroes' Feast: The Deck of Many Morsels}, you will find a curated selection of uniquely D&D recipes, which span the vast multiverse; these were previously only available to your in-game characters. They are all delicious, easy to prepare, and comprise ingredients readily found in this realm. Even better, these snack and drink recipes offer a unique opportunity to enhance the social experience that is D&D, whether it happens to be a game night, or you just wish it were.",
						"However, a word of caution to all who wield this item. It is a deck of power, a deck of might, a deck of unabashed flavor not to be trifled (or truffled) with. Use it carefully and may the dice be good to you!"
