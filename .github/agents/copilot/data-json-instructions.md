# Instructions for 5e.tools JSON editing

- Follow 5e.tools JSON schema (structure/types required).
- Keep entries consistent with existing data conventions in this repo (see docs/DATA_RULES.md).
- Preserve key ordering/formatting patterns used nearby.
- If adding a new source, ensure source metadata is present/updated as required by this repo’s conventions.
- Don’t “invent” new fields unless the renderer supports them.
